-These repos are a work in progress, there are hundreds of pages of notes I'm rereading and editing before commit.

-I've partially censored the actual flag text in an effort to avoid scraping and pissing HTB off, but the process to find it yourself is documented thoroughly.

-Each CPTS module has it's own repo, check <a href="https://github.com/sudo-st8less?tab=repositories">my profile</a> for others<br>
